<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>[TCM], [Acupuncture], [Homeopathy], [Bachflowers], all this kind of
	energetic therapies are not only useful to learn how to improve [health],
	but also how [consciousness] works, how [physical reality] is generated and
	how this [planet] interchange it's own [energy] with us and the entire
	[solar system]. Humans are a [microcosm], a small model of the much bigger
	one. So whatever you try to understand regarding astrophysics, I
	suggest you start with the smaller model which is your [body] and your
	[mind]. And then you will be able to understand also the [macrocosm].</p>
